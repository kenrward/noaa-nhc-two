Google gadget for the graphical Tropical Weather Outlook (TWO) is an experimental graphic that the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is testing and evaluating during the 2007 hurricane season. The experimental Graphical TWO is intended to be a visual companion product to the text TWO. The NHC intends to produce, experimentally during 2007, a graphical TWO twice daily in both the Atlantic and Pacific basins. However, due to the experimental status of these products, the experimental graphic may not always be timely or even available. While the experimental graphical TWO is expected to be available shortly after the operational text TWO, the experimental graphic may take 30 minutes longer (or more) to update following the issuance of the official text TWO. Given its status as an experimental product, users should not rely solely on the graphical TWO for important decisions. Rather, users are urged to continue using the operational text TWO during the 2007 season.
